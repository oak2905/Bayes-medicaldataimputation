# Data

This folder contains dummy data files to provide an idea of the structure of the data used in our project. <br>
We have derived our dataset from the original source as described in the `README.md` file. <br>
The dummy data files contain 12 columns corresponding to 12 analytes as described in the paper and 500 rows corresponding to 500 samples (or 2.5 seconds data since the frequency is 200 Hz).<br>
These data files feature missing values which are imputed by Bayes-CATSI and partial Bayes-CATSI.
